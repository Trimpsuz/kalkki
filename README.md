# abikalkki

Abikalkki is a scientific calculator inspired by [Speedcrunch](https://speedcrunch.org) designed to work fully in the browser. The project is currently maintained for fun and no support is guaranteed.

I started this project to try the [Abitti 2](https://abitti.net/abitti-2-apps.html) application protocol, with the possibility this might get used later if Digabi/YTL finds no suitable replacement for Speedcrunch.

## Usage

You can do these with your *favorite package manager*. I like [Bun](https://bun.sh), but it isn't required to run this.

1. `bun install`
2. `bun run dev`

Tada! You have a dev server running on :5173. Consult package.json 'scripts' for more information.
